# Experiment 03: Various Counters

## Objective:
To develop testbenches and implement different types of counters in Verilog HDL, such as:
1. Ring Counter
2. Johnson Counter
3. Up-Down Counter

### 1. **Ring Counter**:
A ring counter is a type of shift register where the output of the last flip-flop is fed back to the input of the first. It "rotates" the values as it shifts, creating a cyclic pattern. This is useful in applications like time delay and sequential logic.
