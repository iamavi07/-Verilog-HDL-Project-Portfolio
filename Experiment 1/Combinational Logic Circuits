# Experiment 1 - Combinational Logic Circuits

This experiment covers basic combinational circuits: Full Adder, Full Subtractor, 4-bit Adder, Multiplexer, and Demultiplexer. Each module includes both the Verilog HDL code and an exhaustive testbench. 

### 1. Full Adder
A Full Adder adds three 1-bit numbers, `A`, `B`, and `Cin`, producing a sum and a carry-out.

**Files:**
- `FullAdder/FullAdder.v`: Verilog module for the Full Adder
- `FullAdder/tb_FullAdder.v`: Testbench for the Full Adder

### 2. Full Subtractor
A Full Subtractor subtracts two binary numbers and a borrow, producing a difference and borrow-out.

**Files:**
- `FullSubtractor/FullSubtractor.v`: Verilog module for the Full Subtractor
- `FullSubtractor/tb_FullSubtractor.v`: Testbench for the Full Subtractor

### 3. Four-Bit Adder
This is a 4-bit ripple-carry adder made by chaining four Full Adders.

**Files:**
- `FourBitAdder/FourBitAdder.v`: Verilog module for the 4-bit Adder
- `FourBitAdder/tb_FourBitAdder.v`: Testbench for the 4-bit Adder

### 4. Multiplexer (4-to-1)
The multiplexer selects one of the four 4-bit inputs based on a 2-bit selector signal.

**Files:**
- `Multiplexer/MUX.v`: Verilog module for the Multiplexer
- `Multiplexer/tb_MUX.v`: Testbench for the Multiplexer

### 5. Demultiplexer (1-to-4)
The demultiplexer directs a single input to one of four output lines based on two select lines.

**Files:**
- `Demultiplexer/DEMUX_1x4.v`: Verilog module for the Demultiplexer
- `Demultiplexer/tb_DEMUX_1x4.v`: Testbench for the Demultiplexer
